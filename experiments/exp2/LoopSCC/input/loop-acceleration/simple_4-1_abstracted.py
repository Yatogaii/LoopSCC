```python
from cfg import CFG
from int import INT
from spath_graph import SPath_Graph
from summarizer import Summarizer

x = INT.define_int("x")

loop = CFG.define_loop([[x > 1]], [
    (
        ([[x > 1]], [
            (
                (x, (x // 2 + 1) * -2 + x),
            )
        ])
    )
])

spg = SPath_Graph(loop)
summarizer = Summarizer(spg)
summarizer.summarize()

test = [(x, 4194577)]
result = summarizer.solve(test)
for symbol_val in result:
    if symbol_val[0] == "x":
        if int(symbol_val[1]) % 2 == 0:
            **print**("SUCCESS")
        else:
            **print**("FAILED")
```
In this code:

*   We define the input variables `x`.
*   We define the loop condition and body in the format specified.
*   We pass the loop to the SPath_Graph and Summarizer and summarize it.
*   We test the loop with an initial value and assert that the result satisfies the required condition.
*   Note that in your test case, the division and modulo are working on signed numbers. Hence you might need some changes in the C code if you want the same functionality in the python code.

Please note that you might need to adjust the loop definition according to the actual loop in your C code.

Also note that Python supports arbitrary-precision integers, hence you do not need to specify the type of `x` (like `long long int` in C).
