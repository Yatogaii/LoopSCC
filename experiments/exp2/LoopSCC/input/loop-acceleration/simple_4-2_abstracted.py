Here's the Python code that meets the specified requirements:

```python
from cfg import CFG
from int import INT
from spath_graph import SPath_Graph
from summarizer import Summarizer
import z3

x = INT.define_int("x")
x_pre = z3.Int('x_0')
x_post = z3.Int('x')

# START HAVOCABSTRACTION
loop = CFG.define_loop([[x > 0]], [
    [
        ([[x > 0]], [
            (
                (x, x_pre),
            )
        ]),
    ]
])
# END HAVOCABSTRACTION

spg = SPath_Graph(loop)
summarizer = Summarizer(spg)
summarizer.summarize()

summarizer.check_after_loop([x > 0], {"x": x_post}, [x_post % 2 == 0])
```
Please note that since the C code given is hard to convert directly into a while loop as required in the conversion rules, I've considered it as a loop that ends when the condition `x > 0` is met. If the intention was different, please clarify the requirements.
